# Snap Fit
**Hi! If** you're here, it's likely because you're trying to find out how to build a snap fit, and I got you! Personally, I built a [cantilever](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snap-fit#Cantilever) snap fit, but some of the links I've provided should enable you to make multiple different types.

### Hey! Why use a snap fit?
**Security**  
Well, I personally used it in my project in order to not have exterior screws holding together the body. My project is safe-like, so being unable to just unscrew the sides is important. Granted, you also have to carefully design the snap fit to ensure it can't just be unsnapped either. But, it's less visually easy to pick apart.

**Aesthetics**  
If you use snap fits, you can 3D print something instead of laser cutting it in acrylic! Additionally, it minimizes the use of screws on the outside of the box. *~*~*pretty*~*~*
