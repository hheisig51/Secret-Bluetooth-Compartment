### Pseudocode

```c++
void setup() {
    
}

void loop() {
    read nfc
    verify legetimatcy of NFC
    send data back
    if nfc is correct
    {release lock}
    
    if nfc is incorrect 
    {send message back and capture hacker}
}
```

## Weekly Targets

### Week 1 - 2/22/21

#### Goal

Our goal for this week is to figure how the Arduino works**

#### Week 1 Summary

We got our parts and we opened up the Arduino. The arduino that we purchased is the Arduino 33 BLE w/headers. Honestly speaking, we have no idea how to operate this thing. We have used Arduino Uno for the entirity of our "enginnering career". We have to do A LOT of research on how this arduino nano works, and how we can get it to pair with NFC. We can normally look on Google for projects similar to ours, and get ideas and inspiration, but apparently no one has done a project using Arduino Nano + NFC. Someone's got to do it sooo... I guess that's us. We researched a dew sites and used the [Arduino Reference on BLE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/ArduinoBLE) so we could learn more about it. 

**Goal Status - In progress**
