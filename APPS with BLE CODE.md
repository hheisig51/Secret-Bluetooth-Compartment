# Apps w/BLE code

## Lightblue

Lightblue is one of the only apps out there that can communicate with the Nano, and send it inputs. To access working code for this app, you can go into the BLE example sketches, select peripheral, then select LED. This is a basic code for sending inputs from LightBlue, and you can modify it however you want according to your needs. You can also copy the code from below.

```c++
#include <ArduinoBLE.h>

BLEService ledService("19B10000-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214"); // BLE LED Service

// BLE LED Switch Characteristic - custom 128-bit UUID, read and writable by central
BLEByteCharacteristic switchCharacteristic("19B10001-E8F2-537E-4F6C-D104768A1214", BLERead | BLEWrite);

const int ledPin = LED_BUILTIN; // pin to use for the LED

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);
  while (!Serial);

  // set LED pin to output mode
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);

  // begin initialization
  if (!BLE.begin()) {
    Serial.println("starting BLE failed!");

    while (1);
  }

  // set advertised local name and service UUID:
  BLE.setLocalName("LED");
  BLE.setAdvertisedService(ledService);

  // add the characteristic to the service
  ledService.addCharacteristic(switchCharacteristic);

  // add service
  BLE.addService(ledService);

  // set the initial value for the characeristic:
  switchCharacteristic.writeValue(0);

  // start advertising
  BLE.advertise();

  Serial.println("BLE LED Peripheral");
}

void loop() {
  // listen for BLE peripherals to connect:
  BLEDevice central = BLE.central();

  // if a central is connected to peripheral:
  if (central) {
    Serial.print("Connected to central: ");
    // print the central's MAC address:
    Serial.println(central.address());

    // while the central is still connected to peripheral:
    while (central.connected()) {
      // if the remote device wrote to the characteristic,
      // use the value to control the LED:
      if (switchCharacteristic.written()) {
        if (switchCharacteristic.value()) {   // any value other than 0
          Serial.println("LED on");
          digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);         // will turn the LED on
        } else {                              // a 0 value
          Serial.println(F("LED off"));
          digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);          // will turn the LED off
        }
      }
    }

    // when the central disconnects, print it out:
    Serial.print(F("Disconnected from central: "));
    Serial.println(central.address());
  }
}
```

## nRF Connect

This is also a good app that can just connect with the Nano, and you can practice modifying it and testing to see if it connects or not. Here's some code for that:

```c++

#include <ArduinoBLE.h>

static const char* greeting = "Hello World!";

BLEService greetingService("180C");  // User defined service

BLEStringCharacteristic greetingCharacteristic("2A56",  // standard 16-bit characteristic UUID
    BLERead, 13); // remote clients will only be able to read this

void setup() {
  Serial.begin(9600);    // initialize serial communication
  while (!Serial);

  pinMode(LED_BUILTIN, OUTPUT); // initialize the built-in LED pin

  if (!BLE.begin()) {   // initialize BLE
    Serial.println("starting BLE failed!");
    while (1);
  }

  BLE.setLocalName("Nano33BLE");  // Set name for connection
  BLE.setAdvertisedService(greetingService); // Advertise service
  greetingService.addCharacteristic(greetingCharacteristic); // Add characteristic to service
  BLE.addService(greetingService); // Add service
  greetingCharacteristic.setValue(greeting); // Set greeting string

  BLE.advertise();  // Start advertising
  Serial.print("Peripheral device MAC: ");
  Serial.println(BLE.address());
  Serial.println("Waiting for connections...");
}

void loop() {
  BLEDevice central = BLE.central();  // Wait for a BLE central to connect

  // if a central is connected to the peripheral:
  if (central) {
    Serial.print("Connected to central MAC: ");
    // print the central's BT address:
    Serial.println(central.address());
    // turn on the LED to indicate the connection:
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, HIGH);

    while (central.connected()){} // keep looping while connected
    
    // when the central disconnects, turn off the LED:
    digitalWrite(LED_BUILTIN, LOW);
    Serial.print("Disconnected from central MAC: ");
    Serial.println(central.address());
  }
```
