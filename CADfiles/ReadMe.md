# Please read this for some info about the files!
Some Assemblies and Parts are uploaded in two separate versions, due to file size limitations. The 'fine' STL files are zipped up in the repository. The coarser STL files are un-zipped in the repository.

Update **2.13.21**: Enough subtle changes have been made (darn optimizing design!!!) that all the files in the directory are being deleted and re-uploaded. Don't worry, it's all in the cloud.

Update **3.23.21**: Delete and re-up again. Design has been made better suited to 3D printing, and is on it's way to having connectors modeled.

Update **4.27.21** Back again! The snap-fit connectors of the are hopefully at their final stage, and everything else should be soon to follow.
