# Please read this for some info about the files!
The **NanoSub-Assembly** and **FullAssembly** are uploaded as two different versions, due to file size limitations. The 'fine' STL files are zipped up in the repository. The coarser STL files are un-zipped in the repository.

Update **2.13.21**: Enough subtle changes have been made (darn optimizing design!!!) that all the files in the directory are being deleted and re-uploaded. Don't worry, it's all in the cloud.

Update **3.23.21**: Delete and re-up again. Design has been made better suited to 3D printing, and is on it's way to having connectors modeled.
